The Internet of Things (IoT) is defined as "*a proposed development of the internet in which everyday objects have network connectivity, allowing them to send and receive data*” (source: English Oxford dictionary). From medical devices to parking spaces, the IoT brings more and more “things” into the digital world. According to [Gartner's latest projections](http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2636073), billions of sensors and devices will be plugged into the Internet over the next few years, changing the way we perceive data and creating new business opportunities.

But how can we use IoT and how can we benefit from this new “trend”?

#####Monitor
Dirk Paessler, CEO of Paessler AG and a computer networking professional, explains that network monitoring has evolved over time. From Monitoring 1.0, where technology was mainly used to monitor IT devices such as routers or switches, we are now looking at Monitoring 4.0 where every new “thing” can be connected to the network and be monitored (read the full article [here](http://www.paessler.com/blog/2014/05/22/other/monitoring-of-things-exploring-a-new-world-of-data)). There are so many "things" in our environment, which we can monitor that “*it will be difficult to have an out-of-the-box solution that covers every possible scenario*”. 

Wearables, for instance, are the very cutting edge of consumers technology. They are devices we actually wear and they can monitor our heart beat or blood pressure for medical or fitness purposes. The smart cities initiative has also recently emerged. With this initiative, science and industry together try to improve urban life by monitoring for example traffic, air and noise pollution. The concept of smart homes is also becoming more and more popular with thermostats that turn off when you leave the house and doors that communicate with your smart phone to let you know when your kids are back home. You can find more examples of the use of IoT [here](http://postscapes.com/internet-of-things-examples/). Now that we are able to make objects smarter and connected, we can blend the physical world with the digital world of information and ideas in one big, shared network of monitoring. 

#####Visualise
Monitoring the Internet of Things is achieved by collecting and analysing excessive amounts of data. And this is data to be read and accessed not (only) by experienced analysts or scientists but (also) by people with different backgrounds and levels of expertise. Fortunately, we humans are visual creatures. Few of us can detect patterns among raw of numbers, but we can all extract meaningful information from visual representations. Visualising data is also the fastest way to communicate information to others. As Edward Tufte, a famous statistician and artist, wrote: “*graphics can be more precise and revealing than conventional statistics*”.

So monitoring and collecting data is not enough. Representing the data in comprehensible graphics is the key ingredient to transform raw data to meaningful information.

#####Act
And now it’s time to act. We monitor our “things”, we collect and visualise the data in order to make sense of them but none of these are of any value if we do not act upon the derived information. And yes, there is a lot of information. 

IoT monitoring and visualisation can give us insights on real-time as well as historic data and we can benefit from both. The IoT can help consumers achieve goals by greatly improving their decision-making capacity. Nikki Gore from InfoBright notes that “*companies, who recognise that the true value of the realms of data generated by the Internet of Things is the analysis on what is happening “now” and effecting real change to improve their business, are the ones who will realise the huge payoff of the IoT.*”

So every “thing” in our environment can be monitored, but the question is: *what problem do we want to solve?*

What is the main take-away? The IoT opens a range of new business opportunities for a variety of players that monitor, visualise and act. The Internet of Things will have a significant impact on nearly every industry, opening up new business models as well as new sources of operational efficiencies. As the cost of technologies continues to fall and the ecosystem matures, the Internet of Things will shift from a hypothetical possibility to a new way of doing business.
