#### IoT on the hype cycle
<img width="200" height="auto" align="left" src="http://cdn.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/fob-with-notes.jpg"> Internet of Things (IoT for initiates) is getting an immense amount of attention, lately. Examples like NEST and Tesla (though strictly speaking I dare to argue this is not very IoT) speak to the imagination. We, as individuals, love beautiful things. And, isn't it great your Tesla is telling the NEST to prepare the house for imminent arrival, while the passenger seat occupancy is triggering temperature and lighting conditions. In reality the Internet of Things is not there yet. The number of examples that can be put in the IoT category is disappointingly low. There are just not many examples of massive amounts of (inter)connected *things*, yet.

#### Where is the magic?
Then, why are we so extremely excited? Why are companies like Cisco putting so much effort into convincing us they can make 'it' happen? How come every respectable research firm is predicting billions of *things* and trillions of dollars in value created?

Nearly everyone can come up with an example of something that can be improved, when put in the context of Internet of Things. Knowing how offices are used, we can improve the work experience. Considering the harbor a parking lot, wouldn't it be great to see which docks are free and which are taken. Assuming I can't afford a Volvo Ocean Race ship, can I upgrade my boat with sensors to know how much more I can push it.

Our sensory talents as human beings are remarkable. We can see, hear, taste, smell, and feel our way through the world. And each of these senses are so normal we don't even think about it very much, unless we are deprived of input. Because sense is so close to our nature, we *understand* the value of solutions to the problems above.

#### Why is this so difficult?
Breaking down the above three problems we have a number of challenges

1. generic sensors (hardware)
2. (inter)connected and 'online'
3. measure accurately
4. operate reliably
5. generating a massive data stream
6. as input for realtime user defined action
7. displayed in customizable dashboards
8. that never every fail

And, all of this should be easy as pie, because the only affordable way to deploy 10,000 sensors is to do it yourself. One consistent user experience, from device provisioning to dashboard customization and programming actors to notify or act in other ways.

For a small setup, with one or two sensors it is already difficult. Where can you buy your desired sensor combination? How do you collect, store and work with the data? So, imagine what it means to solve this problem for 10k sensors. All the hard problems are there: hardware (manufacturing), distributed systems, big data, realtime data analysis, cross-device user experience, and healthcare reliability.

#### What if we make it simple
We (30MHz) think that we can make this simple. We are solving the problem of sensors by creating a generic solution that can be used in many different situations. It should be so easy that anyone can determine their own sensor collection, order, install and provision, and build a dashboard and create actor scripts. Small scale, urban farming can benefit from this. Large scale industrial plants can also benefit from this.

At this moment we have two product ready for 'easy' implementation. We have ZENSIE room and ZENSIE desk, put in context by ZENSIE mothers creating the network. Once you have a ZENSIE network in place, you can add more ZENSIE functions. You can very easily add ZENSIE climate, for example, measuring things like temperature and humidity.

If you have a sensor type we don't have yet, or an application you can't solve with 30MHz, we would love to start a pilot project with you.
